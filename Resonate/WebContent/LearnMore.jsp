			<p>RESONATE is an online platform where music writers, producers, 
			and performers can come together to create music from anywhere in the world. 
			Writers can upload sheet music and chord progressions, producers can add 
			tracks or ideas, and performers can play the parts available. 
			This allows for private and shareable collaborative folders and groups 
			between different types of users to create music as an end product.</p>
			<p>Listeners can "Vote" for certain parts, 
			resulting in a "Popular" track for a specific part such as drums and  main vocal. </p>
