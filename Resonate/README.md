Works:
Able to sign up/log off
Guest versus Signed Up member difference
	(guests can only browse projects they cannot create projects)
Users can edit profile
Live count works
Can add and select tracks
Can create and choose a project 
Mostly everything else works :D 


Not Work/Scrapped: 
We ended up not implementing roles 
Voting/Liking Projects is the same, there is no UnLiking a project
We can't delete tracks
Can't share a project or delete a project
